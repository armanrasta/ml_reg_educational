# Car Price Prediction Project

This project implements a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features using multiple regression algorithms.

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Main script for data visualization and analysis
- `car_price_model.py`: Model training and evaluation implementation
- `report_generator.py`: Generates detailed model performance reports
- `predict.py`: Interface for making new predictions

## Requirements
```
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
plotly
seaborn
python-docx
matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Train the model:
```bash
python car_price_model.py
```

2. Make predictions:
```bash
python predict.py
```

## Features
- Multiple regression algorithms (Linear, Ridge, Random Forest)
- Interactive visualizations
- Detailed performance reports
- Model evaluation metrics
- Feature importance analysis
